  - chapter_title: Selecting and summarizing columns
    chapter_description: >-
      This chapter provides a brief introduction to working with relational
      databases. You'll learn about their structure, how to talk about them
      using database lingo, and how to begin an analysis by using simple SQL
      commands to select and summarize columns from database tables.

      comparison operators, combine multiple criteria, match patterns in text,
      and much more.

    chapter_description: >-
      Now that you've learned how to select the rows and columns you're most
      interested in, you'll take your analyses to the next level by learning how
      to sort and group tables by variables of interest. In particular, you'll
      see how to combine GROUP BY with aggregate functions like SUM and AVG to
      summarize your data within groups â€” a very powerful paradigm!
