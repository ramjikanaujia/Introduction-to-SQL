## ORDER BY

```yaml

```

Congratulations on making it this far! You now know how to select and filter your results.

In this chapter you'll learn how to sort and group your results to gain further insight. Let's go!

In SQL, the `ORDER BY` keyword is used to sort results in ascending or descending order according to the values of one or more columns. 

By default `ORDER BY` will sort in ascending order. If you want to sort the results in descending order, you can use the `DESC` keyword. For example,

```
SELECT title
FROM films
ORDER BY release_year DESC;
```

gives you the titles of films sorted by release year, from newest to oldest.

<hr>
How do you think `ORDER BY` sorts a column of text values by default?

`@hint`
By default, `ORDER BY` sorts alphabetically, but in which direction?

`@possible_answers`
- [Alphabetically (A-Z)]
- Reverse alphabetically (Z-A)
- There's no natural ordering to text data
- By number of characters (fewest to most)

`@feedback`
- Correct!
- Incorrect. Although text values are ordered alphabetically, they don't go Z-A.
- Incorrect. Text values are ordered alphabetically.
- Incorrect. Text values are ordered alphabetically.

## Sorting single columns (DESC)

```yaml
type: BulletExercise
key: a7b2964ba7
lang: sql
xp: 100
```

To order results in _descending_ order, you can put the keyword `DESC` after your `ORDER BY`. For example, to get all the names in the `people` table, in reverse alphabetical order:

```
SELECT name
FROM people
ORDER BY name DESC;
```

Now practice using `ORDER BY` with `DESC` to sort single columns in descending order!

connect('postgresql', 'films')
set_options(visible_tables = ['films', 'reviews'])
```

## Sorting multiple columns

```yaml
type: BulletExercise
key: b2a52993bc
lang: sql
xp: 100
```

`ORDER BY` can also be used to sort on multiple columns. It will sort by the first column specified, then sort by the next, then the next, and so on. For example,

```
SELECT birthdate, name
FROM people
ORDER BY birthdate, name;
```

sorts on birth dates first (oldest to newest) and then sorts on the names in alphabetical order. **The order of columns is important!**

Try using `ORDER BY` to sort multiple columns! Remember, to specify multiple columns you separate the column names with a comma.

connect('postgresql', 'films')
set_options(visible_tables = ['films', 'people'])

## GROUP BY

```yaml
type: PureMultipleChoiceExercise
key: 81987a99cf
lang: sql
xp: 50
```

Now you know how to sort results! Often you'll need to aggregate results. For example, you might want to count the number of male and female employees in your company. Here, what you want is to group all the males together and count them, and group all the females together and count them. In SQL, `GROUP BY` allows you to group a result by one or more columns, like so:

```
SELECT sex, count(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY sex;
```

This might give, for example:

| sex | count |
|----|----|
| male | 15 |
| female | 19 |

<br>
Commonly, `GROUP BY` is used with _aggregate functions_ like `COUNT()` or `MAX()`. Note that `GROUP BY` always goes after the `FROM` clause!

<hr>
What is `GROUP BY` used for?

`@hint`
You use `GROUP BY` when you want to compute results within groups.

`@possible_answers`
- Performing operations by column
- Performing operations all at once
- Performing operations in a particular order
- [Performing operations by group]

`@feedback`
- Incorrect. While `GROUP BY` does sort by column, we could just use `ORDER BY` for this.
- Incorrect.
- Incorrect. While `GROUP BY` does sort results, it's not designed to control order of operations.
- Correct! `GROUP BY` is for performing operations within groups.

## GROUP BY practice

```yaml
type: BulletExercise
key: 98e30a6131
lang: sql
xp: 100
```

As you've just seen, combining aggregate functions with `GROUP BY` can yield some powerful results!

A word of warning: SQL will return an error if you try to `SELECT` a field that is not in your `GROUP BY` clause without using it to calculate some kind of value about the entire group.

Note that you can combine `GROUP BY` with `ORDER BY` to group your results, calculate something about them, and then order your results. For example,

```
SELECT sex, count(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY sex
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

might return something like

| sex | count |
|----|----|
| female | 19 |
| male | 15 |

<br>
because there are more females at our company than males. Note also that `ORDER BY` always goes after `GROUP BY`. Let's try some exercises!

## HAVING a great time

```yaml

In SQL, aggregate functions can't be used in `WHERE` clauses. For example, the following query is invalid:

```
SELECT release_year
FROM films
GROUP BY release_year
WHERE COUNT(title) > 10;
```

This means that if you want to filter based on the result of an aggregate function, you need another way! That's where the `HAVING` clause comes in. For example,

```
SELECT release_year
FROM films
GROUP BY release_year
HAVING COUNT(title) > 10;
```

shows only those years in which more than 10 films were released.

<hr>
In how many different years were more than 200 movies released?

`@possible_answers`
- 2
- 13
- 44
- 63

`@hint`
Replace 10 with 200 in the query above and run it in the editor.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
connect('postgresql', 'films')
set_options(visible_tables = ['films'])
```

`@sct`
```{python}
msg1 = "It's more than that! Copy and paste the code from the example query, make a small modification, and run it to answer the question!"
msg2 = "That's correct! We're nearing the end of the course, so it's time to combine everything that you've learned and answer some interesting questions!"
msg3 = '44 is the number of different years in which more than 10 movies were released. Make sure to answer the same question but for _200_ movies.'
msg4 = "Not that much! Copy and paste the code from the example query, make a small modification, and run it to answer the question!"
Ex().has_chosen(2, [msg1, msg2, msg3, msg4])

Great work! Now try another large query. This time, all in one go!

Remember, if you only want to return a certain number of results, you can use the `LIMIT` keyword to limit the number of rows returned

`@instructions`
Get the country, average budget, and average gross take of countries that have made more than 10 films. Order the result by country name, and limit the number of results displayed to 5. You should alias the averages as `avg_budget` and `avg_gross` respectively.

`@hint`
```
SELECT ___, AVG(budget) AS avg_budget, 
       ___(gross) AS avg_gross
FROM films
GROUP BY ___
HAVING COUNT(title) > 10
ORDER BY ___
LIMIT 5;
```

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
connect('postgresql', 'films')
set_options(visible_tables = ['films'])
```

`@sample_code`
```{sql}
-- select country, average budget, 
--     and average gross

-- from the films table

-- group by country 

-- where the country has more than 10 titles

-- order by country

-- limit to only show 5 results
```

`@solution`
```{sql}
-- select country, average budget, 
-- and average gross
SELECT country, AVG(budget) AS avg_budget, 
       AVG(gross) AS avg_gross
-- from the films table
FROM films
-- group by country 
GROUP BY country
-- where the country has more than 10 titles
HAVING COUNT(title) > 10
-- order by country
ORDER BY country
-- limit to only show 5 results
LIMIT 5;
```

`@sct`

Ex().check_correct(
    # If end result is ok, all fine all good.
    check_all_columns(allow_extra=False).has_equal_value(ordered=True),

Congrats on making it to the end of the course! By now you should have a good understanding of the basics of SQL.

There's one more concept we're going to introduce. You may have noticed that all your results so far have been from just one table, e.g. `films` or `people`.

In the real world however, you will often want to query multiple tables. For example, what if you want to see the IMDB score for a particular movie?

In this case, you'd want to get the ID of the movie from the `films` table and then use it to get IMDB information from the `reviews` table. In SQL, this concept is known as a **join**, and a basic join is shown in the editor to the right.

The query in the editor gets the IMDB score for the film _To Kill a Mockingbird_! Cool right?

As you can see, joins are incredibly useful and important to understand for anyone using SQL.

We have a whole follow-up course dedicated to them called <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-in-postgresql">Joining Data in PostgreSQL</a> for you to hone your database skills further!
