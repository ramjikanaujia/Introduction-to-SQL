```{r setup}
library(RPostgreSQL)
db <- dbConnect(dbDriver("PostgreSQL"), dbname = "blog", host = "localhost")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection = "db")
```

---

```{sql}
SELECT title
FROM posts;
```

```{sql}
SELECT date_posted, title
FROM posts;
```

```{sql}
SELECT title, date_posted
FROM posts;
```

```{sql}
SELECT * 
FROM posts;
```

```{sql}
SELECT *
FROM reads;
```

Did every user read at least one post? (Will see an easier way to answer this question later.)

```{sql}
SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM reads;
```

Did anyone reread a post?

```{sql}
SELECT DISTINCT user_id, post_id
FROM reads;
```

Which of the following queries returns a list of every date on which at least one person read a blog post?

```{sql}
SELECT DISTINCT date_read
FROM reads;
```

---

```{sql}
SELECT *
FROM users;
```

```{sql}
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM users;
```

```{sql}
SELECT COUNT(username)
FROM users;
```

```{sql}
SELECT COUNT(age)
FROM users;
```

---

```{sql}
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT status)
FROM users;
```

Cleaner answer to previous question about how many dates one or more posts were read:

```{sql}
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT date_read)
FROM reads;
```

---

```{sql}
SELECT AVG(duration)
FROM reads;
```

```{sql}
SELECT AVG(duration), MIN(duration), MAX(duration), SUM(duration)
FROM reads;
```

---

```{sql}
SELECT AVG(duration)/60, SUM(duration)/60
FROM reads;
```

```{sql}
SELECT AVG(duration)/60 AS avg_mins, SUM(duration)/60 AS total_mins
FROM reads;
```

```{sql}
SELECT ROUND(AVG(duration)/60) AS avg_mins, SUM(duration)/60 AS total_mins
FROM reads;
```

---

```{sql}
SELECT *
FROM authors;
```

```{sql}
SELECT *, 2017 - year_joined AS years_writing
FROM authors;
```
