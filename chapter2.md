title: Filtering rows
description: >-
  This chapter builds on the first by teaching you how to filter tables for rows
  satisfying some criteria of interest. You'll learn how to use basic comparison
  operators, combine multiple criteria, match patterns in text, and much more.

## Filtering results

```yaml
type: PureMultipleChoiceExercise
key: bfc80ff2e5
lang: sql
xp: 50
```

Congrats on finishing the first chapter! You now know how to select columns and perform basic counts. This chapter will focus on filtering your results.

In SQL, the `WHERE` keyword allows you to filter based on both text and numeric values in a table. There are a few different comparison operators you can use:

- `=` equal
- `<>` not equal
- `<` less than
- `>` greater than
- `<=` less than or equal to
- `>=` greater than or equal to

For example, you can filter text records such as `title`. The following code returns all films with the title `'Metropolis'`:

```
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE title = 'Metropolis';
```

Notice that the `WHERE` clause always comes after the `FROM` statement!

**Note that in this course we will use `<>` and not `!=` for the not equal operator, as per the SQL standard.**

<hr>
What does the following query return?

```
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year > 2000;
```

`@hint`
If you're stuck, refer to the list of comparison operators above!

`@possible_answers`
- Films released before the year 2000
- [Films released after the year 2000]
- Films released after the year 2001
- Films released in 2000

`@feedback`
- Incorrect. `>` means *strictly* greater than and *not* equal to.
- Correct!
- Incorrect. `>` means *strictly* greater than and *not* equal to.
- Incorrect. `>` means *strictly* greater than and *not* equal to.

## Simple filtering of numeric values

```yaml
type: BulletExercise
key: b90db25f34
lang: sql
xp: 100
```

As you learned in the previous exercise, the `WHERE` clause can also be used to filter numeric records, such as years or ages.

For example, the following query selects all details for films with a budget over ten thousand dollars:

```
SELECT *
FROM films
WHERE budget > 10000;
```

Now it's your turn to use the `WHERE` clause to filter numeric values!

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
connect('postgresql', 'films')
set_options(visible_tables = ['films'])
```

## Simple filtering of text

```yaml
type: BulletExercise
key: b90db25f33
lang: sql
xp: 100
```

Remember, the `WHERE` clause can also be used to filter text results, such as names or countries.

For example, this query gets the titles of all films which were filmed in China:

```
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE country = 'China';
```

Now it's your turn to practice using `WHERE` with text values!

**Important: in PostgreSQL (the version of SQL we're using), you must use single quotes with `WHERE`.**

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
connect('postgresql', 'films')
set_options(visible_tables = ['films', 'people'])

## WHERE AND

```yaml
type: BulletExercise
key: 5bda32d7c8
lang: sql
xp: 100
```

Often, you'll want to select data based on multiple conditions. You can build up your `WHERE` queries by combining multiple conditions with the `AND` keyword.

For example,

```
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year > 1994
AND release_year < 2000;
```

gives you the titles of films released between 1994 and 2000.

Note that you need to specify the column name separately for every `AND` condition, so the following would be invalid:

```
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year > 1994 AND < 2000;
```

You can add as many `AND` conditions as you need!

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
connect('postgresql', 'films')
set_options(visible_tables = ['films'])
```

## WHERE AND OR

```yaml
type: PureMultipleChoiceExercise
key: 227814cb5d
lang: sql
xp: 50
```

What if you want to select rows based on multiple conditions where some but not _all_ of the conditions need to be met? For this, SQL has the `OR` operator.

For example, the following returns all films released in *either* 1994 or 2000:

```
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year = 1994
OR release_year = 2000;
```

Note that you need to specify the column for every `OR` condition, so the following is invalid:

```
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year = 1994 OR 2000;
```

When combining `AND` and `OR`, be sure to enclose the individual clauses in parentheses, like so:

```
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE (release_year = 1994 OR release_year = 1995)
AND (certification = 'PG' OR certification = 'R');
```

Otherwise, due to SQL's precedence rules, you may not get the results you're expecting!

<hr>
What does the `OR` operator do?

`@hint`
Think about records that meet condition1 **and** condition2.

`@possible_answers`
- [Display only rows that meet at least **one** of the specified conditions.]
- Display only rows that meet **all** of the specified conditions.
- Display only rows that meet **none** of the specified conditions.

`@feedback`
- Correct!
- Incorrect. `OR` does not only display rows that meet **all** of the specified conditions.
- Incorrect. `OR` does not display rows that meet **none** of the specified conditions.

---

## WHERE AND OR (2)

```yaml
type: TabExercise
key: ecc1838fc7
lang: sql
xp: 100
```

You now know how to select rows that meet __some__ but not __all__ conditions by combining `AND` and `OR`.

For example, the following query selects all films that were released in 1994 or 1995 which had a rating of PG or R.

```
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE (release_year = 1994 OR release_year = 1995)
AND (certification = 'PG' OR certification = 'R');
```

<hr>

Now you'll write a query to get the title and release year of films released in the 90s which were in French or Spanish and which took in more than $2M gross.

It looks like a lot, but you can build the query up one step at a time to get comfortable with the underlying concept in each step. Let's go!

## BETWEEN

```yaml
type: PureMultipleChoiceExercise
key: a1827199e2
lang: sql
xp: 50
```

As you've learned, you can use the following query to get titles of all films released in and between 1994 and 2000:

```
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year >= 1994
AND release_year <= 2000;
```

Checking for ranges like this is very common, so in SQL the `BETWEEN` keyword provides a useful shorthand for filtering values within a specified range. This query is equivalent to the one above:

```
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year
BETWEEN 1994 AND 2000;
```

It's important to remember that `BETWEEN` is _inclusive_, meaning the beginning and end values are included in the results!

<hr>
What does the `BETWEEN` keyword do?

`@hint`
Think about looking for values **between** a beginning and end point.

`@possible_answers`
- Filter numeric values
- Filter text values
- Filter values in a specified list
- [Filter values in a specified range]

`@feedback`
- Incorrect. `BETWEEN` does not just filter numeric values.
- Incorrect. `BETWEEN` does not just filter text values.
- Incorrect!
- Correct!

## BETWEEN (2)

```yaml
type: TabExercise
key: 9c11f67712
lang: sql
xp: 100
```

Similar to the `WHERE` clause, the `BETWEEN` clause can be used with multiple `AND` and `OR` operators, so you can build up your queries and make them even more powerful!

For example, suppose we have a table called `kids`. We can get the names of all kids between the ages of 2 and 12 from the United States:

```
SELECT name
FROM kids
WHERE age BETWEEN 2 AND 12
AND nationality = 'USA';
```

Take a go at using `BETWEEN` with `AND` on the films data to get the title and release year of all Spanish language films released between 1990 and 2000 (inclusive) with budgets over $100 million. We have broken the problem into smaller steps so that you can build the query as you go along!

## WHERE IN

```yaml
type: BulletExercise
key: 4fc7e638f8
lang: sql
xp: 100
```

As you've seen, `WHERE` is very useful for filtering results. However, if you want to filter based on many conditions, `WHERE` can get unwieldy. For example:

```
SELECT name
FROM kids
WHERE age = 2
OR age = 4
OR age = 6
OR age = 8
OR age = 10;
```

Enter the `IN` operator! The `IN` operator allows you to specify multiple values in a `WHERE` clause, making it easier and quicker to specify multiple `OR` conditions! Neat, right?

So, the above example would become simply:

```
SELECT name
FROM kids
WHERE age IN (2, 4, 6, 8, 10);
```

Try using the `IN` operator yourself!

## Introduction to NULL and IS NULL

```yaml
type: PureMultipleChoiceExercise
key: 5cf67b42b3
lang: sql
xp: 50
```

In SQL, `NULL` represents a missing or unknown value. You can check for `NULL` values using the expression `IS NULL`. For example, to count the number of missing birth dates in the `people` table:

```
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM people
WHERE birthdate IS NULL;
```

As you can see, `IS NULL` is useful when combined with `WHERE` to figure out what data you're missing.

Sometimes, you'll want to filter out missing values so you only get results which are not `NULL`. To do this, you can use the `IS NOT NULL` operator.

For example, this query gives the names of all people whose birth dates are *not* missing in the `people` table.

```
SELECT name
FROM people
WHERE birthdate IS NOT NULL;
```

<hr>
What does `NULL` represent?

`@hint`
Remember, `NULL` represents values which are missing or unknown.

`@possible_answers`
- A corrupt entry
- [A missing value]
- An empty string
- An invalid value

`@feedback`
- Incorrect. We can not be sure that a `NULL` value is actually corrupt.
- Correct! `NULL` is used to represent unknown values.
- Incorrect. An empty string is not the same as a `NULL` value.
- Incorrect!

## LIKE and NOT LIKE

```yaml
type: BulletExercise
key: 84411d78ac
lang: sql
xp: 100
```

As you've seen, the `WHERE` clause can be used to filter text data. However, so far you've only been able to filter by specifying the exact text you're interested in. In the real world, often you'll want to search for a *pattern* rather than a specific text string.

In SQL, the `LIKE` operator can be used in a `WHERE` clause to search for a pattern in a column. To accomplish this, you use something called a _wildcard_ as a placeholder for some other values. There are two wildcards you can use with `LIKE`:

The `%` wildcard will match zero, one, or many characters in text. For example, the following query matches companies like `'Data'`, `'DataC'` `'DataCamp'`, `'DataMind'`, and so on:

```
SELECT name
FROM companies
WHERE name LIKE 'Data%';
```

The `_` wildcard will match a _single_ character. For example, the following query matches companies like `'DataCamp'`, `'DataComp'`, and so on:

```
SELECT name
FROM companies
WHERE name LIKE 'DataC_mp';
```

You can also use the `NOT LIKE` operator to find records that *don't* match the pattern you specify.

Got it? Let's practice!
